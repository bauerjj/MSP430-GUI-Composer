## Introduction
A GUI is configured that plots the data received on a COM port at 9600 baud. The hardware UART on the MSP430 is used in conjunction with two "UART monitor" files that the GUI Composer interacts between as an API. The end result is a distributable standalone app (windows only however). 

## Required Tools

1. Code Composer Studio (CCS) v5.3+
2. MSP430 Launchpad
3. USB mini cable to connect between your computer and MSP430 Launchpad

## Setup
